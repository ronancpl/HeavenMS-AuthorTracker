 The following link teaches on how to install a MapleStory v83 private server, however IT DIFFERS on what is used here: http://forum.ragezone.com/f428/maplestory-private-server-v83-741739/

 Hamachi is optional, though. You don't have to install Hamachi if you want to make the server just for use on your own machine. However, if you want to let other players access your server, consider alternatively using port-forwarding methods.

+### Installing the CLIENT 
 
 The client's set-up is quite straightforward:
-	- From "ManagerMsv83.exe", install MapleStory on your folder of preference (e.g. "C:\Nexon\MapleStory") and follow their instructions.
-	- Once done, erase these files: "HShield" (folder), "ASPLauncher.exe", "MapleStory.exe" and "patcher.exe".
-	- Extract into the client folder the "localhost.exe" from Localhostv83.
-	- Overwrite the original WZ files with the ones provided from "client_wz" folder on the Google Drive.

+2. Once done, erase these files: "HShield" (folder), "ASPLauncher.exe", "MapleStory.exe" and "patcher.exe".
+3. Extract into the client folder the "localhost.exe" from Localhostv83.
+4. Overwrite the original WZ files with the ones provided from "client_wz" folder on the Google Drive.
 
 If you are not using "localhost" as the target IP on the server's config file, you will need to HEX-EDIT "localhost.exe" to fetch your IP. Track down all IP locations by searching for "Text String" "127.0.0.1", and applying the changes wherever it fits.
 
 To hex-edit, install the Neo Hex Editor from "free-hex-editor-neo.exe" and follow their instructions. Once done, open "localhost.exe" for editing and overwrite the IP values under the 3 addresses. Save the changes and exit the editor.
 
 Open the "localhost.exe" client. If by any means the program did not open, and checking que server log your ping has been listened and you are using Windows 8 or 10, it probably might be some compatibility issue. Extract "lolwut.exe" from "lolwut-v0.01.rar" and place it on the MapleStory client folder ("C:\Nexon\MapleStory"). Your "localhost.exe" property settings must follow these:
-	- Run in compatibility mode: Windows 7;
-	- Unchecked reduced color mode;
-	- 640 x 480 resolution;
-	- Unchecked disable display on high DPI settings;
-	- Run as an administrator;
-	- Opening "lolwut.exe", use Fraysa's method.

 Important: should the client being refused to connect to the game server, it may be because firewall issues. Head to the end of this file to proceed to enabling this connection with the computer's firewall. Alternatively, one can deactivate the firewall and try opening the client again.

 DO NOT USE the server's XMLs for reimporting into the client's WZ, it WILL generate some kind of bugs afterwards.
-	- Use instead the HaRepacker 4.2.4, encryption "GMS (old)".
-	- Open the desired WZ for editing and, USING THE UI, make the desired changes.
-	- Save the changed WZ, overwriting the original content at the client folder.
-	- Finally, RE-EXPORT ("Private Server..." exporting option) the changed XMLs into the server's WZ.XML files, overwriting the old contents.

 These steps are IMPORTANT to maintain synchronization between the server and client modules.
 
 As an example of client WZ editing, consider the MobBookUpdate project I developed, for updating all reported drop data of the mobs in the game based on the current drop data on the database:
-	- Open the MobBookUpdate project on NetBeans, located at "C:\Nexon\MapleSolaxia\MobBookUpdate", and build it.
-	- At the subfolder "lib", copy the file "MonsterBook.img.xml". This is from the original WZ v83.
-	- Paste it on the "dist" subfolder.
-	- Inside "dist", open the command prompt by alt+right clicking there.
-	- Execute "java -jar MobBookUpdate.jar". It will generate a "MonsterBook_updated.img.xml" file.
-	- At last, overwrite the "MonsterBook.img.xml" on "C:\Nexon\MapleSolaxia\wz\String.wz" with this file, renaming it back to "MonsterBook.img.xml".

 At this point, the server-side Monster Book has been updated with the current state of the database's drop data. Then, open HaRepacker 4.2.2 and load "String.wz" from "C:\Nexon\MapleStory". Drop the "MonsterBook.img" node by removing it from the hierarchy tree, then (CONTRARY TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE NORMALLY!) import the server's "MonsterBook.img.xml".

 To use portforward, you will need to have permission to change things on the LAN router. Access yor router using the Internet browser. URLs vary accordingly with the manufacturer. To discover it, open the command prompt and type "ipconfig" and search for the "default gateway" field. The IP shown there is the URL needed to access the router. Also, look for the IP given to your machine (aka "IPv4 address" field), which will be the server one.
