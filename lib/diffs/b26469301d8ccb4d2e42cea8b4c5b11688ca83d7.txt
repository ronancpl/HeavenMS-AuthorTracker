+
+    There exist several targets which are by default empty and which can be 
+    used for execution of your tasks. These targets are usually executed 
+    before and after some main targets. They are: 
+
+      -pre-init:                 called before initialization of project properties
+      -post-init:                called after initialization of project properties
+      -pre-compile:              called before javac compilation
+      -post-compile:             called after javac compilation
+      -pre-compile-single:       called before javac compilation of single file
+      -post-compile-single:      called after javac compilation of single file
+      -pre-compile-test:         called before javac compilation of JUnit tests
+      -post-compile-test:        called after javac compilation of JUnit tests
+      -pre-compile-test-single:  called before javac compilation of single JUnit test
+      -post-compile-test-single: called after javac compilation of single JUunit test
+      -pre-jar:                  called before JAR building
+      -post-jar:                 called after JAR building
+      -post-clean:               called after cleaning build products
+
+    (Targets beginning with '-' are not intended to be called on their own.)
+
+    Example of inserting an obfuscator after compilation could look like this:
+
+        <target name="-post-compile">
+            <obfuscate>
+                <fileset dir="${build.classes.dir}"/>
+            </obfuscate>
+        </target>
+
+    For list of available properties check the imported 
+    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. 
+
+
+    Another way to customize the build is by overriding existing main targets.
+    The targets of interest are: 
+
+      -init-macrodef-javac:     defines macro for javac compilation
+      -init-macrodef-junit:     defines macro for junit execution
+      -init-macrodef-debug:     defines macro for class debugging
+      -init-macrodef-java:      defines macro for class execution
+      -do-jar:                  JAR building
+      run:                      execution of project 
+      -javadoc-build:           Javadoc generation
+      test-report:              JUnit report generation
+
+    An example of overriding the target for project execution could look like this:
+
+        <target name="run" depends="MapleIdRetriever-impl.jar">
+            <exec dir="bin" executable="launcher.exe">
+                <arg file="${dist.jar}"/>
+            </exec>
+        </target>
+
+    Notice that the overridden target depends on the jar target and not only on 
+    the compile target as the regular run target does. Again, for a list of available 
+    properties which you can use, check the target you are overriding in the
+    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. 
+
+    -->

Rather, he suggests that it was a place of which bountiful forests rivaled those of current Ellinia. The soil in Perion had been saturated with moisture and nutrients in the past, supporting the necessary conditions for huge plants like Stumpy to grow. However, it has turned into a dry land, and Stumpy, which can be considered a legacy of ancient Perion, now survives on what, little, is left of the barren land.    " />

However, as he got older, he became more and more frightened at the thought of death, which led him to betray his faith and join the demons instead. Death was inevitable even for this powerful figure, however, for the fallen priest had infuriated the god whom he had once worshipped. After his death, his loyal followers buried him in the Forest of Dead Trees... and not too long after the burial, the forest somehow turned into a lair of zombies rising from the dead. Since then, many heroic adventurers have gathered in the forest to defeat the zombies. As heroic adventurers slowly began to overthrow the land of the zombies little by little, putting them at a disadvantage, the fallen priest was revived as the guardian of the zombies. âRiche' now protects the zombies as the ruler of the Forest of Dead Trees.

Vulnerable to Fire Attribute Attacks.\n\nAn odd couple found in the snowfield far from El Nath. Even a serious adventurer would find Yeti and Pepe strange yet hilarious, as they nonchalantly roam the snowfield. Many researchers have sought to discover the origination of this phenomenon for a number of years, but no one has found any evidential basis that can support this anomaly. In any case, the phrase âas close as Yeti and Pepe' was coined based on what people have witnessed." />

At first, the alchemists tried to build a robot more powerful than Roid, but the result of their attempt, Deet, did not have the level of intelligence they had hoped for. Consequently, the alchemists combined Deet and Roid to create the product of best of both worlds. However, with Roid's intelligence and Deet's physical strength combined, this newly improved robot refused to obey the commands of the Alcadno alchemists, causing unforeseen ruckus. After debating what to do with this robot, they decided to play a prank on the Zenumist alchemists. Upon sneaking in this failed invention into the Zenumist lab, Deet and Roi began breaking all the beakers and flasks, leaving no choice for the Zenumist alchemists but to destroy the robot using their renowned magic skills. However, the only way to completely destroy Deet and Roi is to break it into pieces, as even activating the most effective machine in lab 202 could only inflict rusting." />

It is considered a high-ranking dragon, boasting various magic skills as well as high level of intelligence. Its physical strength also contributes to the challenge for adventurers battling against this monster, as it is covered by a firm outer layer and has a breath that can melt even the toughest metals. It can also fly using its small wings. The Manons had an amicable relationship with the Halflings, but for an unknown reason, they have become hostile towards one another. " />

He is known to be too strict and too serious, even attacking approved visitors, saying that they will disturb the Goddess' sleep.  He doesn't get along with the Temple Keeper because of that." />

Horntail assembled an army of evil dragons to create an evil force that instigated the historically-known Dragon War. Horntail seemed to be the more powerful one at the beginning, but Nine Spirit's longstanding experience and wisdom as a leader seemed to overpower Horntail's inexperience. In the end, Horntail broke the Pact between the dragons and Halflings and attacked the Halflings' village, stealing the egg of Nine Spirit which they were protecting. This was a crime that no dragon known as the guardian of order should have committed. Ultimately, Horntail overthrew the reign of Nine Spirit, and the forest was conquered by the demonic servants of Horntail. Since then, no traces of true, honorable dragons could be found in the forest. Horntail, who has three heads and, subsequently, three different minds, is currently hiding in a cave to heal his wounds, and plotting to rule the regions even past Leafre using the egg of Nine Spirit.

+/**
+ *
+ * @author RonanLana
+ * 
+ * This application acts two-way: first section sets up a table on the SQL Server with all the names used within MapleStory,
+ * and the second queries all the names placed inside "fetch.txt", returning in the same line order the ids of the elements.
+ * In case of multiple entries with the same name, multiple ids will be returned in the same line separated by a simple space
+ * in ascending order. An empty line means that no entry with the given name in a line has been found.
+ * 
+ * IMPORTANT: this will fail for fetching MAP ID (you shouldn't be using this program for these, just checking them up in the
+ * handbook is enough anyway).
+ * 
+ * Set whether you are first installing the handbook on the SQL Server (true) or just fetching whatever is on your "fetch.txt"
+ * file (false) on the INSTALL_SQLTABLE property and build the project. With all done, run the Java executable.
