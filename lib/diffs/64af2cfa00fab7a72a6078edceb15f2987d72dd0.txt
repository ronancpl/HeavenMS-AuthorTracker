The Monster Carnival is a place of trilling battles and exciting competiton against people just as strong and motivated as yourself. You must summon monsters and defeat the monsters summoned by the opposing party. That's the essence of the Monster Carnival. Once you enter the Carnival Field, the task is to earn CP by hunter monsters from the opposing party and use those CP's to distract the opposing party from hunting monsters. There are three ways to distract the other party; Summon a Monster, Skill or Protector. Please remember this though, it's never a good idea to save up CP just for the sake of it. The CP's you've used will also help determine the winner and the loser of the carnival.";

+
+    There exist several targets which are by default empty and which can be 
+    used for execution of your tasks. These targets are usually executed 
+    before and after some main targets. They are: 
+
+      -pre-init:                 called before initialization of project properties
+      -post-init:                called after initialization of project properties
+      -pre-compile:              called before javac compilation
+      -post-compile:             called after javac compilation
+      -pre-compile-single:       called before javac compilation of single file
+      -post-compile-single:      called after javac compilation of single file
+      -pre-compile-test:         called before javac compilation of JUnit tests
+      -post-compile-test:        called after javac compilation of JUnit tests
+      -pre-compile-test-single:  called before javac compilation of single JUnit test
+      -post-compile-test-single: called after javac compilation of single JUunit test
+      -pre-jar:                  called before JAR building
+      -post-jar:                 called after JAR building
+      -post-clean:               called after cleaning build products
+
+    (Targets beginning with '-' are not intended to be called on their own.)
+
+    Example of inserting an obfuscator after compilation could look like this:
+
+        <target name="-post-compile">
+            <obfuscate>
+                <fileset dir="${build.classes.dir}"/>
+            </obfuscate>
+        </target>
+
+    For list of available properties check the imported 
+    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. 
+
+
+    Another way to customize the build is by overriding existing main targets.
+    The targets of interest are: 
+
+      -init-macrodef-javac:     defines macro for javac compilation
+      -init-macrodef-junit:     defines macro for junit execution
+      -init-macrodef-debug:     defines macro for class debugging
+      -init-macrodef-java:      defines macro for class execution
+      -do-jar:                  JAR building
+      run:                      execution of project 
+      -javadoc-build:           Javadoc generation
+      test-report:              JUnit report generation
+
+    An example of overriding the target for project execution could look like this:
+
+        <target name="run" depends="MapleArrowFetcher-impl.jar">
+            <exec dir="bin" executable="launcher.exe">
+                <arg file="${dist.jar}"/>
+            </exec>
+        </target>
+
+    Notice that the overridden target depends on the jar target and not only on 
+    the compile target as the regular run target does. Again, for a list of available 
+    properties which you can use, check the target you are overriding in the
+    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. 
+
+    -->

+
+    There exist several targets which are by default empty and which can be 
+    used for execution of your tasks. These targets are usually executed 
+    before and after some main targets. They are: 
+
+      -pre-init:                 called before initialization of project properties
+      -post-init:                called after initialization of project properties
+      -pre-compile:              called before javac compilation
+      -post-compile:             called after javac compilation
+      -pre-compile-single:       called before javac compilation of single file
+      -post-compile-single:      called after javac compilation of single file
+      -pre-compile-test:         called before javac compilation of JUnit tests
+      -post-compile-test:        called after javac compilation of JUnit tests
+      -pre-compile-test-single:  called before javac compilation of single JUnit test
+      -post-compile-test-single: called after javac compilation of single JUunit test
+      -pre-jar:                  called before JAR building
+      -post-jar:                 called after JAR building
+      -post-clean:               called after cleaning build products
+
+    (Targets beginning with '-' are not intended to be called on their own.)
+
+    Example of inserting an obfuscator after compilation could look like this:
+
+        <target name="-post-compile">
+            <obfuscate>
+                <fileset dir="${build.classes.dir}"/>
+            </obfuscate>
+        </target>
+
+    For list of available properties check the imported 
+    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. 
+
+
+    Another way to customize the build is by overriding existing main targets.
+    The targets of interest are: 
+
+      -init-macrodef-javac:     defines macro for javac compilation
+      -init-macrodef-junit:     defines macro for junit execution
+      -init-macrodef-debug:     defines macro for class debugging
+      -init-macrodef-java:      defines macro for class execution
+      -do-jar:                  JAR building
+      run:                      execution of project 
+      -javadoc-build:           Javadoc generation
+      test-report:              JUnit report generation
+
+    An example of overriding the target for project execution could look like this:
+
+        <target name="run" depends="MapleMesoFetcher-impl.jar">
+            <exec dir="bin" executable="launcher.exe">
+                <arg file="${dist.jar}"/>
+            </exec>
+        </target>
+
+    Notice that the overridden target depends on the jar target and not only on 
+    the compile target as the regular run target does. Again, for a list of available 
+    properties which you can use, check the target you are overriding in the
+    nbproject/build-impl.xml file. 
+
+    -->

A total of #r10 questions#k will be given, and the character that answers them all correctly wins the game.\nOnce the question is given, use the ladder to enter the area where the correct answer may be, be it X or O. If the character does not choose an answer or is hanging on the ladder past the time limit, the character will be eliminated. Please hold your position until [CORRECT] is off the screen before moving on. To prevent cheating of any kind, #ball types of chatting#k will be turned off during the OX quiz.\n"/>

If the game cannot be decided within the time period, then the team that rolled the snowball further wins.\nTo roll up the snow, attack it by pressing &quot;C&quot;. \n#bAll long-range attacks and skill-based attack will not work here; only the close-range attacks will#k.\nIf a character touches the snowball, he/she&apos;ll be sent back to the starting point. Attack the snowman in front of the starting point to prevent the opposing team from rolling the snow forward. This is where a well-planned strategy works, as the team will decide whether to attack the snowball or the snowman.\n\nIf you have any other questions regarding the game, feel free to ask during the game.\n"/>
