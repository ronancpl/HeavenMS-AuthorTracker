The server will use that table to gather info regarding rates and intervals.\r\n* MapleIdRetriever - Two behaviors: generates a SQL table with relation (id, name) of the handbook given as input. Given a file with names, outputs a file with ids.\r\n* MapleMapInfoRetriever - Basic tool for detecting missing info nodes on the map field structures (maps failing to have an info node on the WZ is an critical issue).\r\n* MapleMesoFetcher - Creates meso drop data for mobs with more than 4 items (thus overworld mobs), calculations based on mob level and whether it's a boss or not.\r\n* MapleMobBookIndexer - Generates a SQL table with all relations of cardid and mobid present in the mob book.\r\n* MapleMobBookUpdate - Generates a wz.xml that is a copy of the original MonsterBook.wz.xml, except it updates the drop data info in the book with those currently on DB.\r\n* MapleQuestItemFetcher - Searches the SQL tables and project files and reports in all relevant data regarding missing/erroneous quest items.\r\n* MapleSkillMakerFetcher - Updates the DB Maker-related tables with the current info present on the WZs.\r\n* MapleSkillMakerReagentIndexer - Generates a new maker table describing all stat-improvements from the Maker reagents (those empowering crystals and jewels).\r\n\r\nProject:\r\n\r\n* Organized project code.\r\n* Highly configurable server (see all server flags at ServerConstants).\r\n* Fixed/added some missing packets for MoveEnvironment, summons and others.\r\n* Reviewed many Java object aspects that needed concurrency protection.\r\n* Heavily reviewed future task management inside the project. Way less trivial schedules are spawned now, relieving task overload on the TimerManager.\r\n* ThreadTracker: embedded auditing tool for run-time deadlock scanning throughout the server source (relies heavily on memory usage, designed only for debugging purposes).\r\n\r\n---------------------------"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/releases/7295496", "assets_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/releases/7295496/assets", "upload_url": "https://uploads.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/releases/7295496/assets{?name,label}", "html_url": "https://github.com/ronancpl/HeavenMS/releases/tag/rev101", "id": 7295496, "node_id": "MDc6UmVsZWFzZTcyOTU0OTY=", "tag_name": "rev101", "target_commitish": "master", "name": "MapleSolaxiaV2 Reborn", "draft": false, "author": {"login": "ronancpl", "id": 9257761, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkyNTc3NjE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9257761?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl", "html_url": "https://github.com/ronancpl", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "prerelease": false, "created_at": "2017-08-05T22:38:07Z", "published_at": "2017-08-06T00:36:41Z", "assets": [], "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/tarball/rev101", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/zipball/rev101", "body": "========== MapleSolaxiaV2 ==========\r\nCredits:\r\nRonan - Freelance Developer\r\nVcoc - Freelance Developer\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\nFeature list:\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nPQs:\r\n* HPQ/KPQ/LPQ/LMPQ/OPQ/EllinPQ/PiratePQ/HorntailPQ 100%.\r\n* CWKPQ as Expedition-based event 100%.\r\n* Expeditions: Scarga/Horntail/Showa/Zakum/Pinkbean 100%.\r\n* GuildPQ 100% + Guild queue with multi-lobby systems available.\r\n* Brand-new PQ: Boss Rush PQ 100%.\r\n* BalrogPQ semi-functional.\r\n* Capt.
