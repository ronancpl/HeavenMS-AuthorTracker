This is from the original WZ v83.\n-\t- Paste it on the \"dist\" subfolder.\n-\t- Inside \"dist\", open the command prompt by alt+right clicking there.\n-\t- Execute \"java -jar MobBookUpdate.jar\". It will generate a \"MonsterBook_updated.img.xml\" file.\n-\t- At last, overwrite the \"MonsterBook.img.xml\" on \"C:\\Nexon\\MapleSolaxia\\wz\\String.wz\" with this file, renaming it back to \"MonsterBook.img.xml\".\n+* Open the MobBookUpdate project on NetBeans, located at \"C:\\Nexon\\MapleSolaxia\\MobBookUpdate\", and build it.\n+* At the subfolder \"lib\", copy the file \"MonsterBook.img.xml\".

Then, open HaRepacker 4.2.2 and load \"String.wz\" from \"C:\\Nexon\\MapleStory\". Drop the \"MonsterBook.img\" node by removing it from the hierarchy tree, then (CONTRARY TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE NORMALLY!) import the server's \"MonsterBook.img.xml\".\n \n Take note that this is absolutely dangerous if done unwary. Once the MonsterBook.img does not hold client specific data in it's node contents, importing the XML causes no harm at all. However, try not to remove/reimport nodes from WZ files, as it may cause data losses. Use the HaRepacker's UI instead to make the changes.\n \n Save the changes and overwrite the older WZ on the MapleStory client folder.\n \n----- Portforwarding the SERVER ----\n+---\n+### Portforwarding the SERVER\n \n To use portforward, you will need to have permission to change things on the LAN router.
