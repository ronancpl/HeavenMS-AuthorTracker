For each &quot;real world&quot; U.S. Dollar that you authorize us to charge to your credit card, you will be awarded one thousand (1000) units of NX; provided, however, that we reserve the right in our sole discretion at any time to change the number of units you will be entitled to for each &quot;real world&quot; U.S. Dollar.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ONCE YOU AUTHORIZE US OR OTHER DESIGNATED PAYMENT SERVICE TO CHARGE YOUR CREDIT CARD FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT, SUCH AMOUNT SHALL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE REFUNDABLE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT  LIMITATION, UPON TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT FOR ANY REASON, TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, TERMINATION OF THE CASH SHOP AND/OR THE DISCONTINUATION OF THE SERVICE.  You may also be awarded points (&quot;Game Points&quot;) for use in the Cash Shop or through certain of our promoted events.  These Game Points have no &quot;real world&quot; value, but may be exchanged by you for designated Cash Items in the Cash Shop.  Certain Cash Items have an expiration date, while others have no expiration date (&quot;Lifetime Items&quot;).  Each Cash Item that you obtain using NX or Game Points will be included in your Account until the earlier of that Cash Item's expiration date (if it is not a Lifetime Item), your Account\u2019s expiration or termination date, or such date when the Service ends.  REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH ITEMS, YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN THE CASH ITEMS.  We have no liability for &quot;hacking&quot; or loss of your Cash Items from your Account, provided we will use reasonable efforts to replace such items under certain circumstances in our reasonable discretion.  We have no obligation or responsibility to and will not reimburse you for any Cash Item or any experience lost due to your violations of this and any other Company rules, policies, notices and/or agreements.  You understand that any credit card transaction-related information will be treated by the Company in the manner described herein and in our Privacy Policy, and, as applicable, in the manner described in the privacy policy of any third-party payment service that we choose to use.  You agree that all information that you provide to the Company or a designated third-party payment service will be accurate, current and complete.  You hereby agree to pay all charges incurred by you (or your child, if applicable) resulting from your use of the Service at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred.  You will also be responsible for paying any applicable taxes relating to such transactions.  You understand that we may suspend or terminate your Account if for any reason a charge you authorize us to make to your credit card cannot be processed or is returned to us unpaid and, if such event occurs, you shall immediately remit to us payment for such charge through the use of another credit card or other payment mechanism.  We shall not be responsible or liable for any credit card or bank-related charges or fees related to any of your transactions.  We reserve the right, without prior notification, to limit the order quantity on any Cash Item and/or to refuse to provide you with any Cash Item.  Verification of certain information applicable to a transaction involving a Cash Item may be required prior to our acceptance thereof.  Price and availability of the Cash Items are subject to change without notice.  You agree that you cannot and have no right to sell or otherwise transfer any of the Cash Items, or any other content or information included in the Service, in whole or in part, to any third person or entity whatsoever, including, without limitation, on Internet auction sites (e.g., eBay, IGE) or in return for anything of value (including &quot;real&quot; money) or otherwise.  With respect to the MapleStory Trading System, you acknowledge that the items transacted therein will not be transferred with your character when you transfer said character to a different world or change the character name.  In such cases, in order to avoid any item losses, you must first finalize and/or cancel all your transactions in the MapleStory Trading System and keep your items in your Item Inventory prior to making any requests for \u201ccharacter transfers\u201d and/or \u201ccharacter name changes\u201d. \\r\\n\\r\\n\" />\n+    <string name=\"Text48\" value=\"2.4 Hardware and Software Access.

CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT#n.  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the &quot;DMCA&quot;) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.  If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by the Company infringe your copyright (for example, materials posted on one of our Forums), you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked.  The notice must include the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow the Company to locate the material on the Site; (iv) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (v) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed by the Company against you, the DMCA permits you to send the Company a counter-notice.

CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT#n.  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the &quot;DMCA&quot;) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.  If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by the Company infringe your copyright (for example, materials posted on one of our Forums), you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked.  The notice must include the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow the Company to locate the material on the Site; (iv) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (v) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed by the Company against you, the DMCA permits you to send the Company a counter-notice.  Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.

If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by the Company infringe your copyright (for example, materials posted on one of our Forums), you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked.  The notice must include the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow the Company to locate the material on the Site; (iv) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (v) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed by the Company against you, the DMCA permits you to send the Company a counter-notice.
