As you may have read at my thread on RZ, although many aspects of the base source would have been fixed, it was claimed that this source would still have many issues that have not been patched yet. To make it to production for a full-fledged private server many more fixes would still be needed.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the stakes are high on that NO source of a project as large as MapleStory can be deemed \"complete\" altogether, as these things must be extensively tested & treated before setting up a server for the public. Even after publishing it (server made online), most probably there will be problems on the source of the server that must be treated and assimilated to the online server via \"periodic maintenance schedules\".\r\n\r\nLong story short: yes, this source does have many problems (well, every source has). If one wants to make the server online to the public, they must be committed in debugging what is going on the server system they have and find a solution for that.\r\n\r\nNow, regarding this character stuck/character wipe/npc on random positions. If you refer to Solaxia \"last debugging activities before shutdown\", they were on the process on debugging TimerManager, that would be dropping NullPointerExceptions after some period of server activity. The TimerManager is a core mechanic for this server, and the issue troubleshooting for it is still pending (debug it would involve some hours of activity to try to find the bug, I didn't even bother to try for it).

Gave NightWalker's Dark Sight 61 skill points (I'm confident I don't need to do a true distribution as long as the skills add to 61)\r\n- Results in the same error, cannot raise over 41 points to 2nd Job at level 50\r\n\r\n# **So what does this mean**\r\nMy assumption is, the client forbids you from putting more skill points into your corresponding job level in relation to your level. \r\n- Level 50 - (61 SP to 2nd Job only)\r\n- Level 51 - (64 SP to 2nd Job only)\r\n...\r\n- Level 70 - (121 SP to 2nd Job only) / (1 SP to 3rd Job only)\r\n- Level 71 - (124 SP to 2nd Job only <unsure>) / (4 SP to 3rd Job only)\r\n...\r\n- Level 120+ - (No bars held probably)\r\n\r\nIf my assumption is correct, then we'll need to do client modding to solve this issue. However, if this is the case, how do rebirthing servers get around this issue? Perhaps maybe you level too fast to even notice!\r\n\r\nAnd so our team is working on a command-line version to add skill points which bypasses the client check. Of course I'd really love to avoid such complications for players. \r\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/comments/337066113", "html_url": "https://github.com/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/116#issuecomment-337066113", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/116", "id": 337066113, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzA2NjExMw==", "user": {"login": "UltimateMors", "id": 30962403, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTYyNDAz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/30962403?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors", "html_url": "https://github.com/UltimateMors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2017-10-16T22:48:19Z", "updated_at": "2017-10-16T22:48:19Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "Thanks for fixing. :)"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/comments/337066190", "html_url": "https://github.com/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/115#issuecomment-337066190", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/115", "id": 337066190, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzA2NjE5MA==", "user": {"login": "UltimateMors", "id": 30962403, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTYyNDAz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/30962403?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors", "html_url": "https://github.com/UltimateMors", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/UltimateMors/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2017-10-16T22:48:41Z", "updated_at": "2017-10-16T22:48:41Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "Thanks for fixing. :)"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/comments/337114844", "html_url": "https://github.com/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/117#issuecomment-337114844", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/117", "id": 337114844, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzExNDg0NA==", "user": {"login": "ronancpl", "id": 9257761, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkyNTc3NjE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9257761?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl", "html_url": "https://github.com/ronancpl", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2017-10-17T04:31:01Z", "updated_at": "2017-10-17T04:32:53Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "body": "This Number 2 seems like you tried to immediately reenter the event after cancelling/completing the event.

To help clear the case I also took assistance from Rien server source, which had already covered the Raise UI mechanics.\r\n\r\nThis was a nice run through in development for me though. It was already known the client handles quests' `infoNumber-infoEx` to tell whether the player achieved enough progress to complete a quest, only then making the \"complete quest\" tooltip appear on the NPC.\r\n\r\nNow, to have finally come to learn about **how** the server is supposed to update the clients' `infoNumber-infoEx` at this stage of development was astonishing to me, haha. It actually uses the `updateQuestInfo(int quest, String info)` method to update the player, though `infoNumber` being actually an entirely different `questid` to be fed was somewhat out of place in my mind (still, I really should have seen that coming).\r\n\r\nAnyway, new measures have also been done to concurrently protect the progress update (if the new value is over the expected the player cannot complete the quest, since progress checking client-side is actually a string match pattern).\r\n\r\nWell, at last, once again, thanks for sharing!"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/comments/494480310", "html_url": "https://github.com/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/468#issuecomment-494480310", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/468", "id": 494480310, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDQ4MDMxMA==", "user": {"login": "maple006", "id": 50279017, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjc5MDE3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/50279017?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/maple006", "html_url": "https://github.com/maple006", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maple006/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maple006/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maple006/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maple006/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maple006/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maple006/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maple006/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maple006/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/maple006/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2019-05-21T17:17:06Z", "updated_at": "2019-05-21T17:17:06Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Thank You"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/comments/494512733", "html_url": "https://github.com/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/468#issuecomment-494512733", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/468", "id": 494512733, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDUxMjczMw==", "user": {"login": "ronancpl", "id": 9257761, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkyNTc3NjE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9257761?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl", "html_url": "https://github.com/ronancpl", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2019-05-21T18:49:41Z", "updated_at": "2019-05-21T18:49:41Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "body": "Don't worry, I'm glad to receive such issue reports!\r\n\r\nBy myself, I wouldn't be able to even glimpse a lot of issues that I only get to know thanks to people like you who post them here.

use what is called the talk `status`. Let's assume the NPC Base script, slightly modified like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar status;\r\n \r\nfunction start() {\r\n        status = -1;\r\n        action(1, 0, 0);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction action(mode, type, selection) {\r\n        if (mode == -1) {\r\n                cm.dispose();\r\n        } else {\r\n                if (mode == 0 && type > 0) {\r\n                        cm.dispose();\r\n                        return;\r\n                }\r\n                if (mode == 1)\r\n                        status++;\r\n                else\r\n                        status--;\r\n    \r\n                if(status == 0) {\r\n                        cm.sendNext(\"Sample text.\");\r\n                } else if(status == 1) {\r\n                        cm.sendNextPrev(\"More sample text.\");\r\n                } else if(status == 2) {\r\n                        cm.sendYesNo(\"Understood?\");\r\n                } else if(status == 3) {\r\n                        cm.sendOk(\"Bye~\");\r\n                        cm.dispose();\r\n                }\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom there, a few points can get made:\r\n\r\n- When the player inputs click on Ok, Next buttons, `if (mode == 1) status++;` will get triggered, this means an **increase** on the __next time__ the script runs. The No button, as expected, **decrease** the status for the next run time.\r\n\r\n- The script will __run again__ as many times the player inputs a response **or** until `cm.dispose()` happens **or** an `if status <number>` is not caught -- e.g. status 4, it doesn't exist in the script above, but again the script __disposes__ at status 3.\r\n\r\n- Also note, whenever `cm.dispose();` happens, that's the main condition point for the script to finish the NPC conversation.\r\n\r\nHope to have made this clear for you...

However, the solution to be presented acts more specifically at environment-level rather than per program-basis, please keep that in mind.\r\n\r\nEssentially, on the machines requesting connections to the server, with \"Administrator privileges\" at hand (and assuming those machines runs with OS Windows), handle the following:\r\n* Open the **command prompt**. For that: click Start menu, search \"cmd\", then press Enter;\r\n* Type \"`netsh int ipv4 set dynamicport tcp start=<base_port_id> num=<pool_limit>`\", pool_limit: 255+;\r\n* Open the game.\r\n\r\nAssuming all procedures went fine, IoSessions should get pinged within the given range. This should be an action to be implemented on each machine running the game.\r\n\r\nMore info on

But some items are repeated with different prices, thats something you have to fix/edit by yourself..\r\n\r\nOpen harepacker, find the Etc.wz, open it and find Comodity.img, then dump the XML in a folder of your choice, i picked desktop, then open it with notepad+ and you will get a line or lines with the values of the items that appears and the others that don't.. What we have to do now is make all the items on sale, so we must replace all the on sale values and the way to do it pressing Ctrl+F, then click on replace and change:\r\n\r\nint name=\"OnSale\" value=\"0\"/  \r\nfor \r\nint name=\"OnSale\" value=\"1\"/\r\n\r\nIf everything goes fine you will replace around 6500 values on it. Next thing to do is saving the file and then ( i dont know if this is needed but as i did it i'll write it here too) we must replace the values in the Wz file as well, so go back to the harepacker and delete/remove the whole Comodity.img on it, then click on Tools>Import>XML and find the comodity file we just edited and import it ( make sure you click the Etc.wz line in the harepacker before import the comodity to import it sucessfully) it will now have the values, save the Wz file and replace the comodity in your source folder. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow open your source and there must be all the items that were previously hidden in your CS.. \r\n\r\nNow if you want to add an especific item just find the code of the item in comodity.img and change the value Onsale to 1, dump the file in your source, save the wz and the item will appear on it.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/comments/567779016", "html_url": "https://github.com/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/546#issuecomment-567779016", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ronancpl/HeavenMS/issues/546", "id": 567779016, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Nzc3OTAxNg==", "user": {"login": "ronancpl", "id": 9257761, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkyNTc3NjE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/9257761?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl", "html_url": "https://github.com/ronancpl", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ronancpl/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2019-12-20T04:06:02Z", "updated_at": "2019-12-20T04:06:02Z", "author_association": "OWNER", "body": "Understood.
