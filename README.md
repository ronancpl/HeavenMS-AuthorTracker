Tracker developed for HeavenMS study case
<hr>
<p>Reaching Aurora, the 4th released installment of this server source (rev 398, 24th Dec 2019), a self-gauging study case over the development environment has been conducted.</p>
<p>Through transcribing records over a myriad of charts, the elaborated study case is expected to wall off several interesting scenarios: from detecting flows in specific areas of the game along with the progress to analyzing several dashboard concepts (edit rate of files/directories, reactions over time, etc).</p>
